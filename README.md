# Fleetmod (In Progress)
Originally designed by Mikey, taken over by Mest with assistance from Dragon & Badryuiner

This is a plugin for Pulsar Lost Colony, using the Pulsar Plugin Loader
this plugin permits multiple crewed ships in one game, unfortunately without
individual warping, creating Fleets of player controlled ships.

Currently, the officially released varient is "FLEETMOD" in the main branch, version 1.50
this copy of the plugin permits non-modded clients on the admiral ship to function as crew
and modded-clients with the same copy of the FLEETMOD plugin to command and crew additional
ships.

The unofficially released varient is "FLEETMOD-REWRITE" in the secondary branch, version 0.0.1
that copy of the plugin only permits modded clients to join and control ships, providing a
more stable experience of the mod aswell as additional features permitted from having coding
on both host and client of the server. 
THE "FLEETMOD-REWRITE" IS NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND SO IS UNADVISED FOR PLAYTHROUGHS EXCEPT IF
EXPERIMENTING / TESTING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM.
