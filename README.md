# Fleetmod (In Progress)
Originally designed by Mikey, taken over by Mest with assistance from Dragon & Badryuiner.
Wikipedia Page : https://pulsarlostcolony.fandom.com/wiki/Fleet_Mod

This is a mod for Pulsar Lost Colony, using the Pulsar Mod Loader
this plugin permits multiple crewed ships in one game, unfortunately without
individual warping, the mod creates a Fleet of player controlled ships.

Currently, the officially released varient is "FLEETMOD" in the main branch, Pre-release
version 1.6.1 this copy of the plugin permits non-modded clients on the admiral ship to 
function as crew and modded-clients with the same copy of the FLEETMOD plugin to command 
and crew additional ships.

The unofficially released varient is "FLEETMOD-REWRITE" in the secondary branch, version 0.0.1
that copy of the plugin only permits modded clients to join and control ships, providing a
more stable experience of the mod aswell as additional features permitted from having coding
on both host and client of the server. Due to the sheer amount of code to rewrite with Fleetmod, 
the Modders have resorted to merging the rewrite with the original and rewriting it from the
inside out.
THE "FLEETMOD-REWRITE" IS NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND SO IS UNADVISED FOR PLAYTHROUGHS EXCEPT IF
EXPERIMENTING / TESTING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM.
